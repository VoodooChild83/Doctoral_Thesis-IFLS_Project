# Doctoral Thesis Work

In this repo I catalogue the research in support of my dissertation in the Economic Analysis PhD program at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. A lot of this work is currently in progress and changes are always happening.

The current project analyses the effects of internal migration on the human capital attainment of children in Indonesia. Given the endogeneity due to self-selection associated with migration and educational decisions, a discrete choice model is proposed and currently under evaluation as the causal mechanism.

## Data Sources
The source of my data is the [RAND corporation's Indonesian Family Life Survey](http://www.rand.org/labor/FLS/IFLS.html), an on-going longitudinal study of Indonesian households. Hypothesizing that expected wages form the basis of economic migration decisions, I augment the wages of this dataset with the 1995 Indonesian Census available at [IPUMS International.](https://international.ipums.org/international) This is done to yield more consistent estimates of median wages across provinces. To realize wages and other pecuniary costs I utilize GDP deflator and PPP data from the World Bank to transform hourly wages into international dollars for more interpretable results.
